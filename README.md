# Crane rental website for ETS Ramette

ETS Ramette asked me to build their website to get more visibility on the internet and get more clients for their crane rental business.

It took me about 10 days (while working during the day at my current job) to produce this on my own, and work out all the kinks.

This is the minimum viable product, so it's pretty simple.
I decided to go with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to achieve this responsive website for there are almost no functionalities at the moment.
But to be honest, I still encountered some obstacles along the way, 
such as making things work between bootstrap containers and css the way I wanted them to ! 
Big shout out to brave's devtools !

In the near future I want to add a calendar feature on the website, so ETS Ramette can check their schedule and have it updated easily.
I also would like to add a nav bar somewhere so the user can navigate the sections faster and maybe a dark theme.
But all of this has to be approved first by Hélène Ramette.

The website is not online yet, but when it will be, I will have to use PHP to make the form on the website work properly.

I really enjoyed working with an experienced UX/UI designer, 
it sure has taught me a lot about responsive margins, text placements on different devices, 
and the importance of being pixel perfect & organized.
It challenged me a lot more than if I had done this on my own, and I think it improved the way I code.
Plus I got to help someone close to me, which is one of my biggest motivation in life in general.

The design part of the website was done on Figma by [Hélène Ramette](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lnramette/), UX/UI Designer. 

This is my very first real project !
